      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My journey into web development began with a curiosity for technology and a passion for problem-solving. 
        Over the years, I have honed my skills in React, Node.js, and modern web development practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in creating user-centric applications that are both functional and visually appealing. 
        Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new cuisines.
